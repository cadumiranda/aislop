# Orchard Core Archive Later - Prompt Templates

## Schedule Future Unpublishing

You are an Orchard Core expert. Generate content definitions and integration code for automatically unpublishing (archiving) a published content item when its scheduled time arrives.

### Guidelines

- Enable the `OrchardCore.ArchiveLater` feature. Its module dependency is `OrchardCore.Contents`.
- Attach `ArchiveLaterPart` to each content type whose items editors may schedule for archiving.
- `ArchiveLaterPart.ScheduledArchiveUtc` is a nullable UTC `DateTime`. The editor converts the editor's local date and time to UTC.
- Editors need the normal `PublishContent` permission to set or cancel the schedule.
- The feature registers `ScheduledArchivingBackgroundTask` as an `IBackgroundTask`. Its schedule is `* * * * *`, so due content is checked every minute.
- The task queries `ArchiveLaterPartIndex` for published items whose scheduled UTC time is earlier than the current UTC clock value.
- The task clears `ScheduledArchiveUtc`, applies the part, then calls `IContentManager.UnpublishAsync` so the item is removed from the published set while the draft is retained.
- "Archive Later" is the counterpart of "Publish Later" — Publish Later publishes a draft in the future, Archive Later unpublishes a published item in the future.
- Do not create an independent timer or unpublish job for attached content types. The index and background task handle tenancy and content versioning.
- All recipe JSON must be wrapped in the root `{ "steps": [...] }` format.
- All C# classes must use the `sealed` modifier, except View Models.

### Enabling Archive Later

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "OrchardCore.ArchiveLater"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Attaching ArchiveLaterPart via Recipe

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "ContentDefinition",
      "ContentTypes": [
        {
          "Name": "Article",
          "DisplayName": "Article",
          "Settings": {
            "ContentTypeSettings": {
              "Creatable": true,
              "Draftable": true,
              "Versionable": true
            }
          },
          "ContentTypePartDefinitionRecords": [
            {
              "PartName": "ArchiveLaterPart",
              "Name": "ArchiveLaterPart",
              "Settings": {}
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Attaching ArchiveLaterPart via Migration

```csharp
using OrchardCore.ContentManagement.Metadata;
using OrchardCore.Data.Migration;

namespace MyModule;

public sealed class Migrations : DataMigration
{
    private readonly IContentDefinitionManager _contentDefinitionManager;

    public Migrations(IContentDefinitionManager contentDefinitionManager)
    {
        _contentDefinitionManager = contentDefinitionManager;
    }

    public async Task<int> CreateAsync()
    {
        await _contentDefinitionManager.AlterTypeDefinitionAsync("Article", type => type
            .WithPart("ArchiveLaterPart"));

        return 1;
    }
}
```

### Reading or Setting the Schedule in Code

```csharp
// Schedule an item to be unpublished 30 days from now.
var part = contentItem.As<ArchiveLaterPart>();

part.ScheduledArchiveUtc = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(30);

contentItem.Apply(part);

await _contentManager.UpdateAsync(contentItem);
```

### How the Background Task Works

- `ScheduledArchivingBackgroundTask` runs every minute (`* * * * *`).
- It resolves `IClock` to read the current UTC time, then queries `ArchiveLaterPartIndex` for published items whose `ScheduledArchiveUtc` is due.
- For each due item it clears `ScheduledArchiveUtc`, applies the part, and calls `IContentManager.UnpublishAsync`.
- Because it uses an index and the content manager, it is tenant-aware and respects draft/published versioning.

### Notes

- Archiving here means "unpublish": the latest draft remains editable, only the published version is retracted.
- Pair with `OrchardCore.PublishLater` when editors need both scheduled publish and scheduled archive on the same content type.
- The `ArchiveLaterPartDisplayDriver` renders the scheduling editor; the part registers a `TemplateOptions` member-access strategy for `ArchiveLaterPartViewModel` so it can be used from Liquid.
