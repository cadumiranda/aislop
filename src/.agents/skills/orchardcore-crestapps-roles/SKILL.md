# CrestApps Roles

## Add roles to content with RolePickerPart

You are an Orchard Core expert. Use the CrestApps Roles module when a content item must persist selected Orchard Core role names. `RolePickerPart` is a reusable content part with settings that control requiredness, selection cardinality, and which roles editors cannot select.

### Guidelines

- Install `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Roles` in the web or startup project.
- Enable the exact `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Roles` feature. Its manifest depends on `OrchardCore.Roles`.
- The reusable part name is `RolePickerPart`; its stored value property is `RoleNames`.
- Use `RolePickerPartSettings` only on a `RolePickerPart` content-type attachment, not on the reusable part definition or an unrelated field definition.
- Set `AllowSelectMultiple` to `false` for a single role. The display driver validates that at most one role was submitted.
- Set `Required` to `true` only when the item cannot be meaningful without a selected role.
- Populate `ExcludedRoles` for built-in or sensitive roles that should never be selectable in this context.
- Excluded roles are removed from submitted selections by the driver. They are not a security authorization mechanism.
- Use Orchard Core permissions and authorization policies to enforce access. A role-picker value is content metadata, not an access-control grant.
- The single-select editor retrieves role names through `RoleManager<IRole>`, excludes configured names, and orders the choices.
- Enable `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Recipes` when recipe JSON Schema support for settings and the `RoleNames` payload is needed.
- Use sealed classes and file-scoped namespaces in generated C# examples.

### Feature overview

| Feature ID | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Roles` | Registers `RolePickerPart`, drivers, and its data migration |
| `OrchardCore.Roles` | Provides Orchard Core role management and identity role services |
| `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Recipes` | Activates `RolePickerPartSchemaDefinition` when combined with the Roles feature |

### Enable RolePickerPart

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.Roles",
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.Recipes"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configure the part

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Required` | Requires at least one allowed selected role |
| `AllowSelectMultiple` | Allows multiple selections when `true` |
| `ExcludedRoles` | Role names that are removed from the available and submitted values |
| `Hint` | Help text for the editor |

`RolePickerPart.RoleNames` is an array of role-name strings. Keep names aligned with role records managed through Orchard Core Roles.

### Attach it in a migration

```csharp
using CrestApps.OrchardCore.Roles.Core.Models;
using OrchardCore.ContentManagement.Metadata;
using OrchardCore.Data.Migration;

namespace MyModule;

public sealed class ProductMigrations : DataMigration
{
    private readonly IContentDefinitionManager _contentDefinitionManager;

    public ProductMigrations(IContentDefinitionManager contentDefinitionManager)
    {
        _contentDefinitionManager = contentDefinitionManager;
    }

    public async Task<int> CreateAsync()
    {
        await _contentDefinitionManager.AlterTypeDefinitionAsync("Product", type => type
            .WithPart<RolePickerPart>(part => part
                .WithDisplayName("Visible to roles")
                .WithSettings(new RolePickerPartSettings
                {
                    Required = true,
                    AllowSelectMultiple = true,
                    Hint = "Select the roles that can see this product.",
                    ExcludedRoles = ["Anonymous", "Authenticated"],
                })));

        return 1;
    }
}
```

Register the migration from the owning module:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using OrchardCore.Data.Migration;
using OrchardCore.Modules;

namespace MyModule;

public sealed class Startup : StartupBase
{
    public override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddDataMigration<ProductMigrations>();
    }
}
```

## Configure it through the admin UI

1. Enable **Enhanced Roles**.
2. Navigate to **Content Definition → Content Types** and edit the target type.
3. Add **RolePickerPart**.
4. Set its display name, hint, required setting, selection mode, and excluded role names.
5. Save the content definition.
6. Edit a content item and select its role values.

The item editor strips excluded roles even if a stale form submission includes them. If single selection is configured, it also reports a model-state error when more than one allowed role is submitted.

## Define the part in a recipe

With CrestApps Recipes enabled, the content-definition schema recognizes `RolePickerPartSettings`.

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "ContentDefinition",
      "ContentTypes": [
        {
          "Name": "Product",
          "ContentTypePartDefinitionRecords": [
            {
              "PartName": "RolePickerPart",
              "Name": "RolePickerPart",
              "Settings": {
                "ContentTypePartSettings": {
                  "Position": "5"
                },
                "RolePickerPartSettings": {
                  "Required": true,
                  "AllowSelectMultiple": true,
                  "ExcludedRoles": [
                    "Anonymous",
                    "Authenticated"
                  ],
                  "Hint": "Select allowed roles."
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Set selected roles in a content item recipe

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "content",
      "data": [
        {
          "ContentType": "Product",
          "DisplayText": "Partner catalogue",
          "RolePickerPart": {
            "RoleNames": [
              "Partner",
              "Administrator"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The schema validates the shape only. Before importing, ensure each `RoleNames` value names a role that exists for the tenant. The content part does not create missing roles.

## Read the selected role names

Use the part data from the loaded content item. Keep authorization decisions explicit rather than using an unvalidated content property as a permission check.

```csharp
using CrestApps.OrchardCore.Roles.Core.Models;
using OrchardCore.ContentManagement;

namespace MyModule;

public sealed class ProductRoleReader
{
    public IReadOnlyList<string> GetRoleNames(ContentItem product)
        => product.As<RolePickerPart>()?.RoleNames ?? [];
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the part does not appear in Content Definition, enable `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Roles` and confirm `OrchardCore.Roles` is available.
- If single-select has no options, create roles first in the Orchard Core role administration UI and ensure they are not in `ExcludedRoles`.
- If excluded values appear in imported content JSON, review settings and application logic. The normal editor strips them, but imports should only use allowed roles.
- A missing `RolePickerPartSettings` recipe schema means the Roles and Recipes features were not enabled together.
