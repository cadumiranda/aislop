# CrestApps Resources

## Consume CrestApps shared frontend resources

You are an Orchard Core expert. Use `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources` as the shared resource manifest for CrestApps modules. It registers known resource names with Orchard Core Resource Management. Consumers request a resource by name and let Orchard Core select local URLs or configured CDN behavior.

### Guidelines

- Install `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources` in the web or startup project when an application directly depends on its assets.
- Enable the exact `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources` feature. Other CrestApps features can bring it in through their manifest dependencies.
- Request resources by their registered names. Do not hardcode the module's virtual asset paths in a theme or module.
- Use Orchard Core resource tag helpers in Razor so resource management controls rendering and placement.
- Prefer the existing `intl-tel-input` script and style for `PhoneField`; the Content Fields module already depends on this feature.
- CDN-capable resources define local URLs, CDN URLs, versions, and for many resources integrity values. Keep browser CSP and SRI policies compatible with those declarations.
- Resources without a CDN declaration such as `item-selector` and `list-management-ui` are served from the module's local static assets.
- Do not define another manifest entry with an existing name. That makes selection and ordering ambiguous.
- Do not copy vendor files into a consuming module merely to use one of the registered names.
- Resource registration is not a content-feature enablement substitute. Enable the module that owns application behavior separately.
- When adding a new shared resource to this module, add the manifest declaration and local static assets together, then use a unique stable name.

### Feature overview

| Feature ID | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources` | Shared Orchard Core script and stylesheet resource manifest |

### Enable shared resources

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Registered resource names

Use the names in the following table. The implementation registers them in `ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration`.

| Name | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `list-management-ui` | Script | Local CrestApps list management UI |
| `item-selector` | Script and style | Local CrestApps item-selector UI |
| `collapsible-panel` | Script | Local collapsible admin-panel behavior |
| `easymde` | Script and style | EasyMDE editor assets |
| `chart.js` | Script | Local asset with jsDelivr CDN fallback |
| `marked` | Script | Local asset with cdnjs fallback |
| `flatpickr` | Script and style | Local assets with jsDelivr fallback |
| `flatpickr-culture` | Script | Local culture integration script |
| `date-range-picker` | Script | Local date-range picker; depends on `flatpickr` and `flatpickr-culture` |
| `dompurify` | Script | Local asset with cdnjs fallback |
| `highlightjs` | Script and style | CDN-backed Highlight.js and GitHub-style sheet |
| `technical-name-generator` | Script | CrestApps AI chat UI asset |
| `document-drop-zone` | Script and style | CrestApps AI chat UI asset |
| `crestapps-bootstrap-select` | Script and style | CrestApps Bootstrap-select assets; script depends on `bootstrap` |
| `intl-tel-input` | Script and style | International phone input assets |

## Register resources in Razor

Use resource tag helpers with the type and registered name. Add a script at the page foot when it does not need to run before the body is parsed.

```razor
<style asp-name="flatpickr"></style>
<script asp-name="flatpickr" at="Foot"></script>
<script asp-name="flatpickr-culture" at="Foot"></script>
```

For a phone editor, request both portions of the shared library:

```razor
<style asp-name="intl-tel-input"></style>
<script asp-name="intl-tel-input" at="Foot"></script>
```

For a client-side preview that renders Markdown and sanitizes it, request each concern explicitly:

```razor
<script asp-name="marked" at="Foot"></script>
<script asp-name="dompurify" at="Foot"></script>
```

Resource registration ensures the assets are available; it does not sanitize arbitrary HTML automatically. When displaying rendered user content, sanitize the output before assigning it to the DOM.

## Use a resource from a display driver view

Keep view behavior local to the shape. The driver should select the shape, while the view requests only the assets needed by that shape.

```razor
@model MyModule.ViewModels.ChartViewModel

<script asp-name="chart.js" at="Foot"></script>

<canvas id="@Model.CanvasId"></canvas>
<script at="Foot">
    const canvas = document.getElementById("@Model.CanvasId");
    new Chart(canvas, {
        type: "bar",
        data: @Html.Raw(Model.ChartDataJson)
    });
</script>
```

Serialize chart data safely for JavaScript and avoid using untrusted values as raw script text. Request `chart.js` by name rather than a `cdn.jsdelivr.net` URL so environments configured to prefer local assets continue to work.

## Add a shared resource to CrestApps Resources

When extending the source module itself, define a stable resource name and both development and minified local URLs. Add a CDN fallback only when there is a compatible published artifact and known integrity hash.

```csharp
using OrchardCore.ResourceManagement;

namespace CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources;

internal sealed class ExampleResourceRegistration
{
    public static void Add(ResourceManifest manifest)
    {
        manifest
            .DefineScript("example-widget")
            .SetUrl(
                "~/CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources/scripts/example-widget.min.js",
                "~/CrestApps.OrchardCore.Resources/scripts/example-widget.js")
            .SetVersion("1.0.0");
    }
}
```

The actual module configures `ResourceManagementOptions` through `ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration` and adds its `ResourceManifest` there. Do not register an independent manifest from a consuming module merely to duplicate a resource already owned by CrestApps Resources.

## CDN and production guidance

- Test the local path as well as the CDN path. A CDN outage must not hide an incorrect local asset path.
- Respect each registered version and integrity value. Do not declare a newer library version while retaining the old hash.
- `highlightjs` is registered from its CDN path, while several other resources provide both local and CDN alternatives.
- Ensure your CSP permits the CDN hosts only if production is configured to use CDN resources.
- Keep styles before dependent widget initialization scripts, especially for `flatpickr` and `intl-tel-input`.
- Ask the owning module to declare a resource dependency when a resource is intrinsic to that module's UI. Avoid requiring every consuming view to know the asset name.

## Troubleshooting

- If an `asp-name` resource does not render, verify the Resources feature is enabled for the tenant and the name matches the table exactly.
- If a vendor script exists but its matching style does not, check that the resource has a style declaration. Scripts and styles are independent registrations.
- If a CDN resource is blocked, inspect CSP, SRI, and the configured local or CDN preference before replacing the tag with a hardcoded URL.
- If `PhoneField` loses its interactive country selector, verify the Content Fields feature and its Resources dependency instead of adding a second `intl-tel-input` bundle.
