# Orchard Core SignalR - Prompt Templates

## Build Tenant-Aware SignalR Features

You are an Orchard Core expert. Generate accurate real-time hub, route, resource, and client code for the CrestApps SignalR module. It configures SignalR for the Orchard tenant and provides `HubRouteManager` so hubs and generated URLs respect the shell request prefix and site base URL.

### Guidelines

- Install `CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR` in the web/startup project.
- Enable `CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR`.
- Map every module hub through `HubRouteManager.MapHub<T>` rather than `MapHub<T>` with a hard-coded path.
- Generate browser URLs with `HubRouteManager.GetUriByHub<T>(HttpContext)`.
- Use the registered `signalr` resource as a script dependency instead of copying the client library into a theme.
- Keep hub authorization explicit with normal ASP.NET Core or Orchard Core authorization patterns.
- Configure `HubOptions<T>` for a specific hub when its work requires non-default connection timing.
- The module configures camel-case SignalR JSON and registers `JOptions.KnownConverters`.
- Enable `CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR.Redis` when a tenant needs the built-in Redis backplane. It depends on `OrchardCore.Redis`.
- The backplane uses Orchard Core Redis configuration, clones its connection options, and qualifies its channel prefix with the configured instance prefix and the shell name.
- Do not hard-code tenant prefixes, host names, or base URLs in hub JavaScript.
- All recipe JSON must be wrapped in `{ "steps": [...] }`.
- All C# classes must use the `sealed` modifier, except for View Models.

### Feature Overview

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Package | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR` |
| Feature ID | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR` |
| Redis backplane feature | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR.Redis` |
| Route service | `HubRouteManager` |
| Script resource | `signalr` |
| JSON naming | camel case |
| Hub dependency | `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Core` for modules that define hubs |

### Enable SignalR

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## What the Module Registers

The module registers:

- `HubRouteManager` as a scoped service using `ShellSettings.RequestUrlPrefix` and the current site `BaseUrl`.
- ASP.NET Core SignalR through `AddSignalR()`.
- SignalR JSON protocol configuration with `JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase`.
- Orchard JSON converters from `JOptions.KnownConverters`.
- `ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration`, which registers the `signalr` script resource.

The resource has local debug and minified URLs under the module and a CDN definition for `@microsoft/signalr@10.0.0`. Use the resource manager rather than picking a URL manually.

## Define and Map a Hub

Install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Core` in the web/startup project or module that defines the hub. Keep hub behavior in the consuming module; the CrestApps SignalR module provides the host integration.

```csharp
using CrestApps.Core.SignalR.Services;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using OrchardCore.Modules;

namespace MyCompany.OrchardCore.Live;

public sealed class NotificationsHub : Hub
{
    public Task PingAsync()
    {
        return Clients.Caller.SendAsync("pong");
    }
}

public sealed class Startup : StartupBase
{
    public override void Configure(
        IApplicationBuilder app,
        IEndpointRouteBuilder routes,
        IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        HubRouteManager.MapHub<NotificationsHub>(routes);
    }
}
```

`HubRouteManager.MapHub<T>` uses the hub type to establish its route. Avoid declaring the same hub with an additional hard-coded route because tenant URL prefixes and generated links can then diverge.

## Configure Hub Options

Configure a specific hub if it has long-running operations or distinct connection requirements:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;

services.Configure<HubOptions<NotificationsHub>>(options =>
{
    options.ClientTimeoutInterval = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);
    options.KeepAliveInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15);
});
```

Choose values based on expected network and workload behavior. Do not use excessively long timeouts to mask failing hub methods or blocked background work.

## Generate a Tenant-Aware URL

Inject `HubRouteManager` into a Razor view or service:

```cshtml
@inject CrestApps.Core.SignalR.Services.HubRouteManager HubRouteManager

@{
    var hubUrl = HubRouteManager.GetUriByHub<NotificationsHub>(ViewContext.HttpContext);
}
```

The generated URL incorporates the shell request prefix and tenant base URL. This is essential for a tenant mounted below a path, reverse proxies, and non-root deployments.

## Connect from JavaScript

Declare the resource dependency and use the generated URL:

```cshtml
<script at="Foot" depends-on="signalr">
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
            .withUrl("@hubUrl")
            .build();

        connection.on("pong", () => console.log("Connected to notifications."));

        connection.start().catch(error => {
            console.error("SignalR connection failed.", error);
        });
    });
</script>
```

Method and payload names are camel case on the wire because the module configures camel-case JSON. Keep client handlers aligned with the names actually sent by the hub.

## Typed Hubs and Services

Use `Hub<TClient>` when the application benefits from compile-time checking of client contracts:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;

namespace MyCompany.OrchardCore.Live;

public interface INotificationsClient
{
    Task ReceiveNotification(string message);
}

public sealed class TypedNotificationsHub : Hub<INotificationsClient>
{
    public Task NotifyCallerAsync(string message)
    {
        return Clients.Caller.ReceiveNotification(message);
    }
}
```

Authorize hub methods and groups according to tenant permissions. Do not trust a caller-supplied tenant id, user id, or group name to decide authorization.

## Multi-Tenant Behavior

`HubRouteManager` is the tenancy-sensitive integration point. It is scoped because it uses the active shell settings and site settings. Resolve it in the active request or shell scope; do not cache it in a singleton.

Each hub method runs under normal tenant service resolution. Use scoped services for tenant data, and do not retain a `HubCallerContext` or scoped service after a hub call completes.

## Scale-Out and Redis

The base feature registers SignalR, route management, camel-case JSON
configuration, and the browser resource. The optional
`CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR.Redis` feature adds `AddStackExchangeRedis()`
only when Orchard Core Redis services are available.

Enable the Redis feature on every tenant that shares SignalR messages across
nodes:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.SignalR.Redis"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The resulting channel prefix is
`{InstancePrefix}{ShellName}:SignalR`. Preserve `HubRouteManager` for routing
regardless of the backplane choice. Azure SignalR and other scale-out providers
remain hosting decisions outside this module.

## Common Failures

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| 404 on hub negotiation | Enable the SignalR feature and map the hub with `HubRouteManager.MapHub<T>` |
| URL misses tenant prefix | Generate it through `GetUriByHub<T>(HttpContext)` |
| `signalR` is undefined | Add `depends-on="signalr"` and ensure the resource manager renders footer scripts |
| Payload casing differs | Account for the configured camel-case JSON protocol |
| Hub services resolve from the wrong tenant | Avoid singleton caching and resolve services in the active shell scope |
| Multi-node clients miss messages | Enable the Redis backplane feature and configure Orchard Core Redis, or configure another hosting-level provider |
