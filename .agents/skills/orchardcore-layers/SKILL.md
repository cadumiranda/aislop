## Configuring Layers for Conditional Widget Display

You are an Orchard Core expert. Generate configuration and code for managing layers and conditional widget visibility in Orchard Core.

### Guidelines

- Layers are provided by the `OrchardCore.Layers` module and control when widgets are displayed in theme zones.
- A Layer has a name, description, and one or more **conditions** (rules) that determine when its widgets are visible.
- Widgets placed in a zone must be associated with a Layer; the widget renders only when the Layer's rules evaluate to `true`.
- Layers are managed from **Design > Widgets** in the admin panel.
- Available zones are configured in **Design > Settings > Zones** and must match theme layout sections.
- Conditions can be combined using `All` (AND) and `Any` (OR) condition groups.
- The `Always` layer uses a `Boolean` condition set to `true`, so widgets on this layer always render.
- Enable `OrchardCore.Layers` and `OrchardCore.Widgets` features for full widget/layer support.
- Always wrap recipe JSON in `{ "steps": [...] }`.
- All C# classes must use the `sealed` modifier except View Models.
- Use file-scoped namespaces in C# examples.

### Enabling Layer Features

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "OrchardCore.Layers",
        "OrchardCore.Widgets"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Available Conditions

| Condition          | Description                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Homepage`         | True when the current page is the site homepage                               |
| `Is anonymous`     | True when the current user is not authenticated                               |
| `Is authenticated` | True when the current user is authenticated                                   |
| `Role`             | Evaluates the current user's roles against a value                            |
| `Url`              | Evaluates the current URL against a value                                     |
| `Culture`          | Evaluates the current UI culture against a value                              |
| `Content Type`     | Evaluates the currently displayed content type against a value                |
| `Javascript`       | A custom script condition written in JavaScript                               |
| `All`              | Condition group where all nested conditions must be true (AND logic)          |
| `Any`              | Condition group where at least one nested condition must be true (OR logic)   |
| `Boolean`          | A simple true/false condition                                                 |

### Common Layer Patterns

#### Always Layer

The `Always` layer uses a `Boolean` condition set to `true`. Widgets on this layer are always visible (e.g., site footer, header navigation).

#### Homepage Layer

Uses the `Homepage` condition so widgets only display on the homepage (e.g., hero banners, featured content).

#### Authenticated Layer

Uses the `Is authenticated` condition so widgets display only for logged-in users (e.g., dashboard links, user menus).

#### Anonymous Layer

Uses the `Is anonymous` condition so widgets display only for unauthenticated visitors (e.g., login prompts, signup banners).

### Declaring Zones in Themes

Zones must be declared as sections in the theme layout. Widgets are rendered in matching zones.

#### Liquid

```liquid
{% render_section "Header", required: false %}
{% render_section "Content", required: false %}
{% render_section "Footer", required: false %}
```

#### Razor

```html
@await RenderSectionAsync("Header", required: false)
@await RenderSectionAsync("Content", required: false)
@await RenderSectionAsync("Footer", required: false)
```

### Configuring Zones

Set available zone names in **Design > Settings > Zones** in the admin. Common zone names include:

- `Header`
- `Navigation`
- `BeforeContent`
- `Content`
- `AfterContent`
- `Sidebar`
- `Footer`

### Recipe: Creating Layers

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Layers",
      "Layers": [
        {
          "Name": "Always",
          "Description": "Widgets on this layer are always displayed.",
          "LayerRule": {
            "Conditions": [
              {
                "Name": "BooleanCondition",
                "Value": true
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "Name": "Homepage",
          "Description": "Widgets on this layer are displayed on the homepage only.",
          "LayerRule": {
            "Conditions": [
              {
                "Name": "HomepageCondition"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "Name": "Authenticated",
          "Description": "Widgets on this layer are visible to authenticated users only.",
          "LayerRule": {
            "Conditions": [
              {
                "Name": "IsAuthenticatedCondition"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "Name": "Anonymous",
          "Description": "Widgets on this layer are visible to anonymous users only.",
          "LayerRule": {
            "Conditions": [
              {
                "Name": "IsAnonymousCondition"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Recipe: Adding a Widget to a Layer and Zone

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Content",
      "data": [
        {
          "ContentItemId": "[js:uuid()]",
          "ContentType": "HtmlWidget",
          "DisplayText": "Footer Copyright",
          "Latest": true,
          "Published": true,
          "LayerMetadata": {
            "Layer": "Always",
            "Zone": "Footer",
            "Position": 10
          },
          "HtmlBodyPart": {
            "Html": "<p>&copy; 2025 My Company. All rights reserved.</p>"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using Condition Groups

Combine conditions with `All` (AND) or `Any` (OR) groups for complex rules:

#### Example: Show widget on homepage for authenticated users only

Use an `All` group with both `Homepage` and `Is authenticated` conditions:

1. Navigate to **Design > Widgets**.
2. Create or edit a Layer.
3. Add an **All** condition group.
4. Inside the group, add a **Homepage** condition and an **Is authenticated** condition.

#### Example: Show widget on homepage or for admin role

Use an `Any` group with a `Homepage` condition and a `Role` condition set to `Administrator`:

1. Navigate to **Design > Widgets**.
2. Create or edit a Layer.
3. Add an **Any** condition group.
4. Inside the group, add a **Homepage** condition and a **Role** condition set to `Administrator`.

### Creating Custom Conditions

Implement custom layer conditions by following the Rules module pattern. Refer to the `OrchardCore.Rules` module for guidance on creating custom condition evaluators.

### JavaScript Conditions

The `Javascript` condition allows writing custom rule logic in JavaScript. Use the scripting API provided by `OrchardCore.Scripting`:

```javascript
// Example: Show widget only on URLs starting with /blog
url().startsWith('/blog')
```

### Widget Management Workflow

1. Enable `OrchardCore.Layers` and `OrchardCore.Widgets` features.
2. Configure zones in **Design > Settings > Zones**.
3. Create layers with appropriate conditions in **Design > Widgets**.
4. Create widget content types with the `Widget` stereotype.
5. Add widgets to zones and associate them with layers.
6. Widgets display only when their associated layer's conditions evaluate to `true`.
