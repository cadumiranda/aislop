# Orchard Core Phone Number Verifications - Prompt Templates

## Verify Contact Phone Numbers

You are an Orchard Core expert. Generate accurate code, settings, recipes, and integration guidance for the CrestApps Phone Number Verifications module. It is a provider-agnostic framework that persists verification data on content items and supports later revalidation.

### Guidelines

- Install `CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Verifications` in the web/startup project.
- Enable a provider feature as well as the core verification feature; a provider feature enables the core feature through its dependency.
- The core feature depends on `OrchardCore.Contents` and `CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers`.
- Attach `PhoneNumberVerificationPart` only to content types representing a contact or another verified number owner.
- Use `IPhoneNumberVerificationManager` to select and invoke the configured provider.
- Store results with `PhoneNumberVerificationPartExtensions`, not a hand-written parallel data structure.
- Do not equate a transport/provider failure with `Invalid`; failures are retryable.
- Use `IPhoneNumberVerificationProvider` to add a provider and give it a stable provider key.
- Add provider settings as a site display driver rather than application-wide static configuration.
- Let the built-in background task throttle and revalidate due records.
- Install external-provider packages and CrestApps packages in the web/startup project.
- All recipe JSON must be wrapped in `{ "steps": [...] }`.
- All C# classes must use the `sealed` modifier, except for View Models.

### Features

| Feature | Feature ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Core | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Verifications` | Parts, manager, settings, index, queue, report, and scheduled revalidation |
| AbstractAPI | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Verifications.AbstractApi` | AbstractAPI Phone Validation provider |
| Veriphone | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Verifications.Veriphone` | Veriphone provider |
| Twilio | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Verifications.Twilio` | Twilio Lookup provider |

### Enable a Provider

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Verifications",
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Verifications.Twilio"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Enable exactly the provider features that the tenant can configure. The framework is useful without a provider only for existing stored data; it cannot newly verify numbers until a provider is enabled and configured.

## Architecture

| Abstraction | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `IPhoneNumberVerificationProvider` | Calls an external provider and returns `PhoneNumberVerificationResult` |
| `IPhoneNumberVerificationManager` | Resolves the selected provider, runs verification, and invokes lifecycle handlers |
| `PhoneNumberVerificationProviderOptions` | Holds registered provider descriptors keyed by provider key |
| `PhoneNumberVerificationPart` | Persists normalized verification data on a content item |
| `PhoneNumberVerificationPartExtensions` | Reads and updates the part and serialized result |
| `IPhoneNumberVerificationHandler` | Receives verification lifecycle notifications |
| `PhoneNumberRevalidationBackgroundTask` | Finds due records and processes revalidation |

Provider keys identify a provider independently of its display name. The built-in keys are exposed through `PhoneNumberVerificationsConstants.Providers`.

## Configure Settings

Open **Settings → Phone Number Verifications**:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Default provider | First enabled provider | Provider chosen when no explicit valid selection exists |
| Revalidation interval | `365` days | How long a completed result remains current |
| Maximum verification attempts | `3` | Consecutive failed requests allowed before manual attention is required |
| Request delay | `1000` ms | Delay between background provider requests |

Each enabled provider feature adds a tab to the same settings screen. Enable the provider on that tab and enter the provider credentials. A provider appears in the default-provider list only when its enable switch is on.

Secrets saved by a provider settings driver must be protected. Do not put API keys in recipes, source code, client-side configuration, or reports.

## Attach the Content Part

Attach **Phone Number Verification Part** to a contact content type through **Content → Content Definition → Content Types**. The migration creates an attachable `PhoneNumberVerificationPart` definition.

The part stores:

| Data | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PhoneNumber` | Submitted number |
| `NormalizedPhoneNumber` | E.164 number returned by the verification flow |
| `LastVerifiedUtc` and `LastVerifiedByUserId` | Completed-verification audit data |
| `VerificationProvider` and `VerificationStatus` | Provider identity and normalized state |
| `VerificationResultJson` | Full normalized result payload |
| `VerificationAttemptCount` and `FailedAttemptCount` | Lifetime and consecutive failure counts |
| `LastError` and `LastAttemptUtc` | Retry diagnostic information |
| `NextVerificationDueUtc` | Revalidation scheduling value |

The module maintains `PhoneNumberVerificationPartIndex` for common reporting and queue queries. Do not query serialized JSON when an indexed field is sufficient.

## Explicit Verification

Resolve `IPhoneNumberVerificationManager`, call `VerifyAsync`, then update the part using the extension method:

```csharp
using CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Core.Models;
using CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers.Core.Services;
using OrchardCore.ContentManagement;

namespace MyCompany.OrchardCore.Contacts;

public sealed class ContactVerificationService
{
    private readonly IPhoneNumberVerificationManager _verificationManager;

    public ContactVerificationService(IPhoneNumberVerificationManager verificationManager)
    {
        _verificationManager = verificationManager;
    }

    public async Task VerifyAsync(
        ContentItem contentItem,
        string phoneNumber,
        string userId,
        int revalidationIntervalDays,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var result = await _verificationManager.VerifyAsync(phoneNumber, cancellationToken: cancellationToken);

        contentItem.AlterPhoneNumberVerificationResult(
            result,
            verifiedByUserId: userId,
            revalidationIntervalDays: revalidationIntervalDays);
    }
}
```

Use `contentItem.TryGet<PhoneNumberVerificationPart>(out var part)` to check whether the content type carries the part. Use `TryGetPhoneNumberVerificationResult` to read the stored normalized result.

## Result and Status Semantics

`PhoneNumberVerificationResult` is the abstraction returned by
`IPhoneNumberVerificationProvider`. `IPhoneNumberVerificationManager.VerifyAsync`
accepts a phone-number string, an optional provider key, and a cancellation
token. It selects the configured or default provider; providers do not select
themselves.

| Outcome | Correct behavior |
|---|---|
| Provider returns valid/invalid answer | Persist `Verified` or `Invalid` result |
| Rate limit, HTTP, or parsing failure | Record a retryable failure; do not mark the number invalid |
| Existing verified result and later provider outage | Retain the completed status and due date while recording the failure |
| Completed provider response after failures | Reset failed count and last error |

The raw provider response can be retained in `VerificationResultJson`, but UI and reporting should use the normalized result model. Avoid displaying provider raw payloads to untrusted users.

## Background Revalidation and Queue

`PhoneNumberRevalidationBackgroundTask` runs every five minutes. It locates due records, processes bounded throttled batches, and uses distributed locking so multiple instances do not duplicate work.

After the configured maximum consecutive failures, a record is shown as **Needs attention** and stops automatic retries. Administrators with the appropriate permission can requeue a single item, selected items, or all matching failed records from the **Tools → Phone Verifications Queue**.

Queue retry actions set records pending and defer actual provider requests until after state is saved. Do not build a synchronous bulk web action that calls every external provider immediately.

## Omnichannel Contacts

When `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Omnichannel.Managements` is enabled, `OmnichannelContactPhoneNumberVerificationHandler` examines contact methods. It prefers `Cell`, then `Home`, `Office`, `Work`, and `Other`, stores a changed value as unverified in the current content save, and schedules external verification after that save.

This handler is feature-gated. Do not assume it runs for arbitrary custom contact types unless they use the matching Omnichannel model.

## Custom Providers

Reference the Phone Numbers abstractions and implement the provider:

```csharp
using CrestApps.OrchardCore.PhoneNumbers;

namespace MyCompany.OrchardCore.Verifications;

public sealed class MyPhoneNumberVerificationProvider : IPhoneNumberVerificationProvider
{
    public Task<PhoneNumberVerificationResult> VerifyAsync(
        string phoneNumber,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Call the remote service and map its response to the common result model.
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

Register a named provider in a dedicated feature startup:

```csharp
services.AddHttpClient(nameof(MyPhoneNumberVerificationProvider))
    .AddStandardResilienceHandler();

services.AddPhoneNumberVerificationProvider<MyPhoneNumberVerificationProvider>(
    "MyProvider",
    options =>
    {
        options.DisplayName = S["My Provider"];
        options.Description = S["Verifies phone numbers with My Provider."];
    });
```

Use the provider registration overload that includes a settings type when the
provider has tenant settings. It adds the keyed provider and an
`IPhoneNumberVerificationProviderConfiguration` that determines whether that
provider is selectable. Keep the provider key and keyed-service registration
identical.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| No provider is selected | Enable and configure at least one provider tab |
| Results do not persist | Attach `PhoneNumberVerificationPart` to the content type |
| A failure shows invalid | Correct the provider mapping; request failures must remain retryable |
| Background work is slow | Tune request delay and provider limits, not unbounded concurrent calls |
| Records never retry | Check maximum attempts, due date, and queue failure state |
| Contact changes do not verify | Confirm the Omnichannel Management feature and contact-method structure |
