# Orchard Core AI Tools - Prompt Templates

## Register and Select AI Tools

You are an Orchard Core expert. Generate secure AI tool registration and selection patterns for CrestApps AI Services. A tool is a named `AITool` registered in the shared Core tool definitions and resolved as a keyed service when an authorized completion needs it.

### Guidelines
- Enable `CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI` for the Orchard Core AI tool selection and permission integration.
- Register a tool through `AddCoreAITool<TTool>(name)` and give it a unique, stable name.
- `AddCoreAITool` registers the keyed `AITool` service and its definition under the same name. Do not register an unrelated duplicate keyed service.
- A new Core tool is hidden by default. Call `.Selectable()` only when Orchard users should be able to select it.
- Set title, description, and category with the returned builder; these values drive capability pickers.
- `GetSelectableTools()` excludes tools marked as system tools. System tools are for internal orchestration paths and are not shown in capability pickers.
- `LocalToolRegistryProvider` returns only names configured on the completion context, skips system tools, and checks `AccessAITool` authorization.
- The provider resolves a selected tool from DI with `GetKeyedService<AITool>(toolName)`.
- Tool selection is stored as `FunctionInvocationMetadata.Names` for AI Profiles.
- Profile-source templates store selected names in `ProfileTemplateMetadata.ToolNames`.
- Chat Interactions store selected names in `ChatInteraction.ToolNames`.
- Direct-config workflow tasks store selected names in `AICompletionWithConfigTask.ToolNames`.
- Capability editors group tools by category and filter them by the current editor's permission.
- The `AccessAnyAITool` permission is security-critical. Dynamic `AccessAITool_{toolName}` permissions are created for registered definitions.
- Do not make privileged system-management, content-management, or external side-effect tools available by default.
- Tool metadata must accurately describe side effects, required access, and argument expectations so orchestration can select safely.
- Install CrestApps packages in the web/startup project.

### Feature Overview

| Feature | Feature ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| AI Services | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI` | Tool capability editors, dynamic permissions, and local registry |
| Orchard Core AI Agent | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI.Agent` | Orchard-admin and system tools |
| AI Chat Interactions | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI.Chat.Interactions` | Interaction-level tool selection |
| Orchard Core Workflows | `OrchardCore.Workflows` | Direct-config workflow task tool selection |

### Install and Enable

Install AI Services in the web/startup project:

```shell
dotnet add package CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI
```

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI",
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI.Agent"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Enable `CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI.Agent` only when the site needs its Orchard-management tool catalog. A custom local tool does not require the Agent feature.

### Register a Custom Tool

Register a named tool in the web/startup project or custom Orchard module. The shared Core registration API adds its definition and keyed service:

```csharp
using CrestApps.Core.AI.Tooling;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace MyModule;

public sealed class Startup : OrchardCore.Modules.StartupBase
{
    public override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddCoreAITool<LookupOrderTool>("lookup_order")
            .WithTitle("Order Lookup")
            .WithDescription("Looks up a customer's order status by order identifier.")
            .WithCategory("Commerce")
            .Selectable();
    }
}
```

Implement the tool using the shared `AITool` contract and a JSON schema that limits arguments. Give the tool a narrow description and perform authorization before accessing tenant data or making an external call.

### Tool Sources and Registry Resolution

The orchestrator can combine registry sources. For local Orchard registrations:

1. `AddCoreAITool` adds a definition to `AIToolDefinitionOptions` and a keyed `AITool` service.
2. A profile, interaction, or workflow task supplies selected tool names in its completion context.
3. `LocalToolRegistryProvider` finds matching definitions.
4. It excludes entries where `IsSystemTool` is true.
5. It authorizes the current user against `AIPermissions.AccessAITool` and the tool name resource.
6. It resolves the keyed `AITool` instance and returns a local `ToolRegistryEntry`.

System tools follow a separate Core system-registry path. Orchard's
`LocalToolRegistryProvider` resolves explicitly selected non-system tools in
the current tenant and user authorization context. Do not expect system tools
in profile, template, interaction, workflow-task, or post-session capability
pickers.

### Select Tools on an AI Profile

1. Register and authorize the tool.
2. Go to **Artificial Intelligence → Profiles**.
3. Edit the profile and open **Capabilities**.
4. Select tools in the grouped tool list.
5. Save the profile.

`AIProfileToolsDisplayDriver` saves the names in `FunctionInvocationMetadata`. It also reads the legacy `AIProfileFunctionInvocationMetadata` property for compatibility, but new integrations must use the current metadata.

### Select Tools on a Profile Template

Only templates with `Source = Profile` show the tools editor:

1. Create or edit a profile-source template.
2. Select tools under **Capabilities**.
3. Save the template.
4. Create a profile from the template.

`AIProfileTemplateToolsDisplayDriver` stores `ProfileTemplateMetadata.ToolNames`, which can seed the generated profile configuration.

### Select Tools on a Chat Interaction

Enable the interactions feature first:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI",
        "CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI.Chat.Interactions"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

`ChatInteractionToolsDisplayDriver` filters selectable tools by the editing user's access and persists the selected names on `ChatInteraction.ToolNames`.

### Use Tools in a Workflow Task

The **AI Completion using Direct Config** task accepts selected local tools. It configures `ChatToolMode.Auto`, resolves each selected name through `IAIToolsService`, and uses function invocation middleware with the configured maximum iterations.

```liquid
{{ Workflow.Output["AI-order-summary"].Content }}
```

Use a direct-config task only for tightly controlled workflow automation. Prefer a dedicated profile when the completion should inherit a reusable profile policy and capability set.

### Tool Permissions

`AIToolPermissionProvider` registers:

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AccessAnyAITool` | Security-critical permission that implies access to registered tools |
| `AccessAITool` | Base tool access permission |
| `AccessAITool_{toolName}` | Dynamic permission for a specific registered tool |

`OrchardCoreAIToolAccessEvaluator` delegates tool decisions to Orchard Core `IAuthorizationService`. Grant access per tool rather than granting `AccessAnyAITool` to ordinary users.

### Security Checklist

- Model every tool as an explicit capability, not as an implicit extension of a profile.
- Use strict JSON schemas and validate all input before an external call or data mutation.
- Require the least-privileged `AccessAITool_{toolName}` permission.
- Keep destructive operations separate from read-only lookup tools.
- Mark internal orchestration-only tools as system tools so administrators cannot select them accidentally.
- Test with both authorized and unauthorized users before exposing a tool on a production profile.
