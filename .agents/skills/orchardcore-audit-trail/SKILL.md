# Orchard Core Audit Trail - Prompt Templates

## Configure Audit Trail and Event Tracking

You are an Orchard Core expert. Generate audit trail configurations, custom event providers, and AuditTrailPart setups for Orchard Core.

### Guidelines

- Enable `OrchardCore.AuditTrail` for audit event recording.
- The Audit Trail provides an immutable, auditable log of system events (content changes, user events, etc.).
- Events are logged automatically for supported actions (create, publish, delete content items; user login failures, etc.).
- The audit trail list supports filtering by date range, category (Content, User, etc.), and sorting.
- Content events show version history, diffs, and allow restoring previous versions or deleted items.
- Restored content items are created as drafts that must be manually published.
- Attach `AuditTrailPart` to content types to let editors add comments to audit trail entries on save.
- Configure which events to record via **Settings** → **Audit Trail**.
- Client IP address logging is optional and may require GDPR/privacy compliance considerations.
- Trimming settings control how long events are retained in the database.
- Custom modules can provide their own audit trail event handlers.
- Always seal classes.

### Enabling Audit Trail

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Feature",
      "enable": [
        "OrchardCore.AuditTrail"
      ],
      "disable": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Audit Trail Event Categories

| Category | Events | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Content** | Created, Published, Unpublished, Removed, Cloned, Restored | Tracks content item lifecycle events. |
| **User** | LoggedIn, LogInFailed, PasswordReset, PasswordChanged | Tracks user authentication and account events. |

### Audit Trail Event List Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Date Range Filter** | Filter events to a specific time period. |
| **Category Filter** | Filter by event category (e.g., Content, User). |
| **Sorting** | Sort entries by various parameters (date, category, user). |
| **Version Link** | Click to view the read-only editor of a content item at that version. |
| **Display Text Link** | Click to edit the latest version of the content item. |
| **View Button** | View the content item at the recorded version. |
| **Restore Button** | Restore a content item to a previous version (creates a draft). |
| **Details Link** | View detailed event information, including textual diffs for content events. |

### Attaching AuditTrailPart via Migration

```csharp
using OrchardCore.ContentManagement.Metadata;
using OrchardCore.ContentManagement.Metadata.Settings;
using OrchardCore.Data.Migration;

namespace MyModule;

public sealed class AuditTrailMigrations : DataMigration
{
    private readonly IContentDefinitionManager _contentDefinitionManager;

    public AuditTrailMigrations(IContentDefinitionManager contentDefinitionManager)
    {
        _contentDefinitionManager = contentDefinitionManager;
    }

    public async Task<int> CreateAsync()
    {
        await _contentDefinitionManager.AlterTypeDefinitionAsync("{{ContentTypeName}}", type => type
            .WithPart("AuditTrailPart", part => part
                .WithPosition("20")
            )
        );

        return 1;
    }
}
```

### Attaching AuditTrailPart via Recipe

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "ContentDefinition",
      "ContentTypes": [
        {
          "Name": "{{ContentTypeName}}",
          "DisplayName": "{{DisplayName}}",
          "ContentTypePartDefinitionRecords": [
            {
              "PartName": "AuditTrailPart",
              "Name": "AuditTrailPart",
              "Settings": {
                "ContentTypePartSettings": {
                  "Position": "20"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Audit Trail Settings

Configure at **Settings** → **Audit Trail**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Event Recording** | Enable or disable recording for specific event types. |
| **Client IP Logging** | When enabled, the client IP address is included in audit trail events. Requires GDPR/privacy compliance. |
| **Trimming** | Configure retention period for audit events. Disable trimming to keep events indefinitely. |
| **Content Tab** | Select which content types should have their events recorded. |

### Creating a Custom Audit Trail Event Provider

Implement `IAuditTrailEventHandler` to record custom events:

```csharp
using OrchardCore.AuditTrail.Services;
using OrchardCore.AuditTrail.Services.Models;

namespace MyModule.AuditTrail;

public sealed class CustomAuditTrailEventHandler : AuditTrailEventHandlerBase
{
    public override Task CreateAsync(AuditTrailCreateContext context)
    {
        if (context is AuditTrailCreateContext<CustomAuditEvent> customContext)
        {
            customContext.AuditTrailEventItem.Action = "Created";
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

public sealed class CustomAuditEvent
{
    public string Action { get; set; }
}
```

### Recording a Custom Audit Trail Event

```csharp
using OrchardCore.AuditTrail.Services;
using MyModule.AuditTrail;

namespace MyModule.Services;

public sealed class MyService
{
    private readonly IAuditTrailManager _auditTrailManager;

    public MyService(IAuditTrailManager auditTrailManager)
    {
        _auditTrailManager = auditTrailManager;
    }

    public async Task PerformActionAsync()
    {
        // Perform your action...

        // Record the audit trail event.
        await _auditTrailManager.RecordEventAsync(
            new AuditTrailContext<CustomAuditEvent>(
                name: "CustomAction",
                category: "MyModule",
                correlationId: "{{CorrelationId}}",
                userId: "{{UserId}}",
                userName: "{{UserName}}",
                auditTrailEventItem: new CustomAuditEvent()
            )
        );
    }
}
```

### Registering Custom Audit Trail Event Handler

```csharp
using OrchardCore.AuditTrail.Services;
using OrchardCore.Modules;

namespace MyModule;

public sealed class Startup : StartupBase
{
    public override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddScoped<IAuditTrailEventHandler, CustomAuditTrailEventHandler>();
    }
}
```

### Content Event Diff Tracking

The Audit Trail module tracks diffs between content versions:

- **Current version values** are shown in green.
- **Previous version values** are shown in red.
- Access diffs via the **Details** link → **Diff** tab in the audit trail list.

### Audit Trail Trimming Configuration

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Settings",
      "AuditTrailTrimmingSettings": {
        "RetentionDays": 90,
        "Disabled": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enabling Content-Specific Audit Trail

To track specific content type events:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Audit Trail** → **Content** tab.
2. Select the content types to track.
3. Save the settings.

Only events for selected content types will be recorded, reducing noise in the audit log.

### Best Practices

- Attach `AuditTrailPart` to critical content types (e.g., pages, policies) for edit comments.
- Enable IP logging only when required and ensure privacy compliance.
- Set a reasonable trimming period (e.g., 90–365 days) to manage database size.
- Use the Details/Diff view to investigate content changes before restoring.
- Custom event providers should use descriptive category and event names for easy filtering.
